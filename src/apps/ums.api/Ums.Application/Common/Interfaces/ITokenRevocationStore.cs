/// HARDENING-03: Tracks revoked user sessions.

/// When a user is deleted or blocked, their JWT may still be valid for up to the
/// token TTL (typically 15–60 minutes). This store allows the API to reject requests
/// from those users immediately, without waiting for token expiry.
///
/// Implementations:
/// - <see cref="InMemoryTokenRevocationStore"/> — single-node, dev/test, not durable.
/// - Redis-backed implementation (production) — shared across all pods, durable.
///   Replace registration in DI by switching to AddStackExchangeRedisCache() and
///   implementing ITokenRevocationStore against IDistributedCache.
///
/// Consumer: <c>TokenRevocationMiddleware</c> checks this on every authenticated request.
/// Producer: domain event handlers for <c>UserDeletedEvent</c> and <c>UserBlockedEvent</c>.
