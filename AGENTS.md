## Project
Enterprise Monorepo for User Management System (UMS). An authorization block prototype capable of working with third-party Identity Providers or operating standalone, using .NET 10, React 18, PostgreSQL, and BMAD-METHOD.

## Build & Run
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The technical engine of this monorepo is located in `src/`. All technical commands must be executed relative to that directory.

Commands for Frontend (run from `src/`):
- Frontend Install: `npm install`
- Frontend Start: `npx nx run app-web:dev`
- Setup Docs Context (Context7): `npx ctx7 setup`
- Markdown Encoding Sanitation: `python3 ../.bmad-core/scripts/cleanup_markdown_encoding.py`

Commands for Backend (run from `./src/apps/ums.api/` or the root solution directory):
- Backend Build: `dotnet build`
- Backend Test: `dotnet test`
- Backend Run: `dotnet run`

## Architecture
- Runtime: **.NET 10** (Backend) and React v18 + Vite (Frontend).
- Monorepo: Managed via Nx, npm Workspaces (Frontend) and standard .NET SLN.
- DB: PostgreSQL + Entity Framework Core (EF Core through Npgsql).
- Key Modules: `src/apps/ums.api` (.NET Backend), `src/apps/ums.web-app` (Frontend React Portal).
- Pattern: Modular Monolith, Clean Architecture, Explicit Bounded Contexts, CQRS-oriented reads, REST + GraphQL queries.

## Conventions
- **Engineering Patterns**: Adhere to **Clean Architecture** (Hexagonal), **SOLID** principles, and strict **DDD** bounded contexts.
- **AI-Driven Strategy**: Utilize the **BMAD-METHOD** for spec-driven development and numerical sequential documentation (Phases 00 to 05).
- **Domain Purity**: Strictly isolate Domain rules from external frameworks.
  - JS/TS: Hexagonal boundaries and strict linting.
  - C#: `{BoundedContext}.Domain` project must be pure POCOs with zero NuGet references.
- **Flow Control**: Utilize the **Result Pattern** instead of throwing application exceptions for domain flow control.
- Enforce strict TypeScript and C# types with static analysis gates (SonarJS).

## Agent Rules
- NEVER delete or bypass existing tests to make a fix pass.
- Before updating dependencies, verify strict dependency pinning.
- If modifying core logic, ensure architectural traceability to approved ADRs.
- Keep formatting clean, adhering to ESLint and Prettier configs in the workspace.
- **BMAD Rule Compliance:** Any agent working on this repository MUST read, prioritize, and strictly enforce the 14 rules defined in `.bmad-core/rules/global-rules.md`, `.bmad-core/rules/structuring-standard.md` (R-13), and `.harness/rules/project-rules.yaml`. If encoding artifacts (mojibake) or non-standard decorative characters (emojis/icons) are detected, the agent MUST run the appropriate cleanup utilities immediately to enforce rules R-03 and R-14. No code or documentation commits are permitted without validating against these rules.
- **BMAD Audit Skills:** Any agent performing analysis, implementation, refactoring, or verification MUST also use the project playbooks in `.harness/playbooks/` for API audits, frontend audits, documentation audits, and modular-monolith evolution reviews.
- **Multi-language Synchronization & Diagram Validation:** Whenever documentation is updated, the agent MUST ensure that both English and Spanish versions are synchronized in content, technical precision, and clarity. Additionally, all Mermaid diagrams MUST be validated for syntax and structural correctness before any commit. See [Documentation Control Agents](./docs/governance/documentation-control-agents.md) for detailed bilingual consistency rules.
- **Context Retrieval:** Always use **Context7** (`npx ctx7`) to fetch updated, version-specific documentation for third-party libraries before implementing complex external integrations.
- **Corporate Standards Alignment:** Any agent making architectural design decisions MUST query the **Corporate Reference** via Context7 (`use context7 for beyondnetcode/evolith_arch32`) to ensure absolute compliance with baseline polyglot standards and authoritative patterns.
- **Tenancy Enforcement:** Application-layer tenant filtering is the primary isolation mechanism. PostgreSQL row-level security, schema ownership, constraints, and database policies are secondary infrastructure failsafes and must never replace application-layer filtering in requirements, ADRs, code, or documentation.
- **Functional Story Standard:** Functional stories must keep business narrative readable for Product Owners and Business Analysts, and place technical detail in a dedicated `Technical Requirements` section per `docs/governance/requirements/functional-stories/functional-story-standard.md`.
- **Configuration Catalog Standard:** Any parameter, configuration, policy, feature flag, workflow, or master catalog entity must follow the mandatory `code`, `value`, `description` standard and update model, ORM, migrations, and documentation together.

## Out of Bounds
- DO NOT modify CI/CD GitHub workflows.
- DO NOT edit Git hooks (Husky configuration).
- DO NOT modify core corporate library standards unless authorized.
